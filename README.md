AutoPark-android
=========
Project Description:
-------
Autopark is an Android based application that receives real-time videos from the roads.  
By using real-time object detection system we are analyzing the data that we receive from every frame we get.  
If a parking was spot, the app notify the server and update the DB, only if this parking isn’t exist in current data of the DB.  
Autopark shows the user a map with all of the available parking in his area, or by the search area he enters.  
Users get real time updates, and whenever a new spot is found, it automatically appears on the map.  
Autopark uses the information it collects from the users in order to update the database.
